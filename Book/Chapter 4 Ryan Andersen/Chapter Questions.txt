4.5 - a predicate function is a function that returns a boolean value. 4.1 (d) is an example of when to use a predicate function, and would look like this:

	}

4.8 - they are now circled.

4.19 - It doesn't work because the variables are being passed in by value, instead of by reference. Here's what it should look like: 
	void false_swap2(int& a,  int& b){
		int temp = a;
		a = b;
		b = temp;
	}
