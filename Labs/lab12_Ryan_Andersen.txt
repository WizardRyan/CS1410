// Description: a psuedo-code file for practicing memory management


//I declare that the following source code was written solely by me.
//I understand that copying any source code, in whole or in part, 
// constitutes cheating, and that I will receive a zero on this project
// if I am found in violation of this policy.


// The overloaded assignment operator, assigns one DynArray to another
// accepts rho, a DynArray object
// returns a DynArray

// check for self assignment, if so, return this

// delete any values in the current object
    
// create an array big enough to hold rho's data

// copy that data

// return the new DynArray (this)
